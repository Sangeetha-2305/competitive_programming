Arrays & String

1. Linear Data Structure
2. Ordered
3. Index starts 0.
4. Same Data Type.
5. Object (because new).
6. Default - Integer = 0, Boolean = false, Object = null, Character = '\0'
7. Fixed Size.
8. Can Contain Duplicates.
9. Arrays oda function passing Call by Reference.

ALGORITMS:

1. Two Pointer. (Sorting)
2. Sliding Window Algorithm. (Sub-array)
3. Dynamic Programming. (Recursion) 
4. Greedy.
5. Quick Sort.

FORMATIONS:

1. 1D -> ROW. []
2. 2D -> ROW & COLUMN.
[]

DISCLAIMERS:

1. We cannot use the Enhanced For Loop to get the elements in an Array.
2. While accessing indices, [i + 1] != (i++)
